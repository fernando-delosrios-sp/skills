# openspec-init

## 1. Setup & Initialization

- **Check Requirements**: Install the `openspec` CLI if it is not available (`npm install -D openspec` or `-g`).
- **Initialize**: Run `openspec init`. Ask the user to select their preferred AI tools if not automatically inferred. Stop and wait for their response before proceeding.
- **Completion Criterion**: `openspec` CLI is available and `openspec init` has completed.

## 2. Schema Selection & Installation

- **List Schemas**: List the available default schemas from this skill's `schemas/` directory.
- **Select Schema**: Ask the user to choose one. Stop and wait for their choice.
- **Copy Schema**: Copy the chosen schema directory from this skill's `schemas/` folder to the target repository's `openspec/schemas/` directory.
- **Validate**: Run `openspec schema validate <schema-name>`. Attempt to fix errors or ask the user for guidance.
- **Completion Criterion**: The chosen schema directory exists in `openspec/schemas/` and validation passes.

## 3. Schema Instructions

- **Check Instructions**: Check for `INSTALL.md` in the copied schema directory.
- **Execute**: If it exists, read and follow all instructions within it.
- **Completion Criterion**: All instructions in `INSTALL.md` are executed, or no `INSTALL.md` exists.

## 4. Configuration

- **Build Config**: Build `openspec/config.yaml` by following `references/config.md`.
- **Completion Criterion**: `openspec/config.yaml` exists and contains `schema`, `context`, and `rules` sections.

## 5. Initial Spec Generation

- **Discover Domains**: Analyze the project structure to infer logical domains. Ask the user to confirm or adjust these domains. Stop and wait for their response.
- **Pre-populate**: Create the confirmed domain subdirectories in `openspec/specs/` and generate an initial `spec.md` for each. For structural groupings (e.g. "services"), create a spec for *each* individual service found.
- **Completion Criterion**: `openspec/specs/` contains at least one domain subdirectory with an initial `spec.md` file.

## 6. Recommended Skills Installation

- **Install Skills**: Ask the user for permission to install the required behavioral skills using `npx skills add fernando-delosrios-sp/skills --skill <skill-name>`:
   - `c4-diagram`
   - `gherkin-authoring`
   - `changelog-generator`
   - `openspec-git-discipline`
- **Completion Criterion**: The skills have been installed or the user explicitly skipped this step.
