# Edit RISEN Prompt

Create structured RISEN prompts from messy notes OR audit existing RISEN prompts.

## Determine Mode

- **CREATE** (default): `$1` is messy notes → transform to complete RISEN
- **AUDIT** (`--audit` flag): `$1` is existing RISEN → score and recommend

## CREATE Mode

### Phase 1: Analysis

1. Read the file
2. Identify existing sections, gaps, task type

### Phase 2: Structure Enhancement

**Role**: Extract/infer identity + competencies (concise, context-specific)

**INPUT**: Organize into priority tables:

- Priority 1 (HIGH): Critical documents
- Priority 2 (MED): Supporting context
- Priority 3 (LOW): Reference material
- Use `@./path` format for file references

**STEPS**: Apply step pattern from library (see reference.md):

- Research → Analysis → Creation (deliverables)
- Audit → Recommend → Implement (optimization)
- Explore → Design → Build (new features)
- Gather → Synthesize → Document (knowledge)
- Review → Refine → Validate (quality)

Add: `.ctx` management, checkpoints, model specs (Sonnet for analysis, Opus for creative), resumability

**EXPECTATIONS**: Deliverable format, audience, quality standards, final package, quality gates

**NARROWING**: Compliance, audience specificity, style constraints, no hallucinations, checkpoint discipline

### Phase 3: Output

Write to `[original-name]-risen.md` in same directory.

## AUDIT Mode

### Phase 2B: Score each section (0-5)

- **Role**: Identity defined? Competencies listed? Context-specific?
- **INPUT**: Priority tables? `@./path` format? Descriptions?
- **STEPS**: Sequential workflow? Checkpoints? .ctx management? Model specs?
- **EXPECTATIONS**: Deliverables defined? Audience? Quality standards?
- **NARROWING**: Compliance? Constraints? Quality gates?

**Overall**: X/25 — Excellent (20-25) | Good (15-19) | Needs Work (10-14) | Poor (<10)

### Phase 3: Output

Write audit report to `[original-name]-audit.md`.

See `reference.md` for step pattern library, .ctx management, model selection, audit template.
